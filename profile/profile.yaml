    description: I worked closely with stakeholders and technical teams to gather requirements and design a system that met the needs of the organization. This involved preparing Business Requirement Documents (BRD) that highlighted the need statements, project scope, key stakeholders, project schedules and deadlines, cost-benefit analysis among other important requirements. In addition, I prepared the Software Requirement Document that described use cases and features of the application It defined the scope of the work, functional and non-functional requirements, data models, assumptions and constraints and the acceptance criteria.

    description: I was responsible for developing a Java-based application that emulated the functionalities of the Linux command, grep. The application was designed to recursively search files within a directory and output the lines that matched the specified output file. To achieve this, I worked closely with the technical team to design and develop the application using Maven, a popular project management tool. Through this process, I ensured that the app met all functional requirements and was user-friendly for easy adoption and use by stakeholders.

    description: carried out data collection by gathering relevant datasets on cervical cancer, cleaned and pre-processed the data to make it suitable for analysis. Exploratory data analysis was done to identify patterns, correlations, and trends. Feature engineering was carried out by identifying the most important features for predicting cervical cancer and engineering new features. The analyst developed machine learning models using various techniques, evaluated the model performance using appropriate metrics, fine-tuned the models for improved performance and deployed the model in a production environment.
