# Tomi Aina . Jarvis Consulting

I currently work as a software developer with Jarvis consulting, where I work on different projects on Linux cluster management, Java applications, spring boot REST API, and others. I am also completing a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering. My research is focused on using computer vision techniques to diagnose cervical cancer lesions found in females. I am proficient in data analysis and providing insights to businesses using data. I have experience teaching undergraduate and postgraduate student.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_TomiAina](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_TomiAina)


**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_TomiAina/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that stores each server/node's hardware specifications and monitors resource usage (e.g. CPU usage) in real-time. The data is stored in an RDBMS database (PostgreSQL) which can be used for reporting and, in the future, resource planning.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_TomiAina/tree/master/core_java)]: Developed a java-based app that has the functionalities of a grep linux command. It recursively searches files in a directory andd outputslines that matches the specifies output file. It was built and managed using Maven.


## Highlighted Projects
**Development of a deep-learning based cervical screening system**: Developed a Computer Vision-based- system that can detect cervical cancer lesions using a mobile phone. A mobile application is developed that can automatically screen cervix images in real-time. It was designed to aid screening, particularly in low-resource regions and could potentially reduce the prevalence of cervical cancer in these regions.

**Optimization of Household Energy Management System**: Developed a Household Energy Management System that aims to minimize customers' electricity bills by predicting the operation time of appliances in the home with the real-time electricity price and renewable energy resources integrated with the home.
